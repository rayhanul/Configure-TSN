# Traffic run: result-2026-10-10-dataset-testbed-4-saf/rl-c9-on/4-matrix-c9on, 2026-10-10 18:06

20 flows, 30 s, S1/S2/S3 concurrently, all senders starting at the same TAI instant on the GCL grid (`basetime.json`). Mode: NIC launch time (1000 µs sender lead), NIC RX timestamps, real-time processes. Raw output: `results_<node>.log`.

## Summary

- Delivered: **1012483 / 1012483 packets (100.00%)**
- Deadline misses: **0 (0.00% of received)**; flows with zero misses: 11 / 20

| receiving node | flows | delivered | avg latency (µs) | deadline misses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | 1 | 100.00% | 27.3 | 0.00% |
| S2 | 4 | 100.00% | 29.8 | 0.00% |
| S3 | 6 | 100.00% | 37.4 | 0.00% |

Setup at start:

- S1: ptp4l/phc2sys active/active, CLOCK_TAI − UTC 37.0 s, ptp4l `[7192691.373] port 1 (enp1s0): assuming the grand master role`
- S2: ptp4l/phc2sys active/active, CLOCK_TAI − UTC 37.0 s, ptp4l `[7195426.180] rms    8 max   15 freq  -6210 +/-  11 delay    26 +/-   0`
- S3: ptp4l/phc2sys active/active, CLOCK_TAI − UTC 37.0 s, ptp4l `[887683.210] rms   33 max   77 freq  +2972 +/-  45 delay    49 +/-   0`
- Connectivity: 11 / 11 sender routes answered ping

## Drop counters (during the run)

| node | UDP receive-buffer drops | launch-time (etf) drops | frames skipped by sender (too late) |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| S2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| S3 | 0 | 0 | 17 |

Switch queue drops (`ethtool -S` Q DROP) on the 17 gated ports: none.

## Per flow

Latency = receiver NIC's hardware RX timestamp − sender NIC's launch time (the sender's NIC sends each frame at its scheduled time via SO_TXTIME + etf offload), both on PTP-synced NIC clocks: NIC to NIC, no software time involved. Schedule e2e = the scheduler's end-to-end bound. Jitter: standard deviation of latency, and RFC 3550 (mean |Δ latency| between consecutive packets). Deadline miss = latency > deadline. No NIC ts = frames received without a hardware timestamp (counted as received, left out of latency).
